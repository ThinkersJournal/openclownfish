# Changelog

## 0.0.14

- Emitter: strided schedule (transposed, broadcast, rank-3, Coord) in Baracuda's argument convention, bit-exact on every device (X2).

## 0.0.13

- Emitter: f64 behind cl_khr_fp64 (OpenClC::for_extensions); OpenClC is now a struct, use OpenClC::new() (X2).

## 0.0.12

- Emitter: six comparisons and Select, bit-exact over the NaN/inf/zero grid on every device (X2).

## 0.0.11

- Device limits and extensions (compute units, work-group size, memory, fp64/fp16); probe prints host OS and limits; docs/device-reports.md (H1).

## 0.0.10

- Emitter: Max, Min, FmaxIeee, FminIeee, Pow; parser lifts OpenCL math names via Unpopped 0.35.3 Frontend tables (X1/X2).

## 0.0.9

- Emitter: abs, sqr, recip, sqrt, rsqrt, exp, log with device differential tests (X2).

## 0.0.8

- X1 v1: OPENCL_C frontend lifts elementwise OpenCL C kernels to the IR (feature parse); emitter accepts Vectorized plans.

## 0.0.7

- Added openclownfish-clc: v1 OpenCL C emitter (f32 contiguous elementwise) with a device-vs-oracle differential test (X2).

## 0.0.6

- Safe layer part 2: Program (build log surfaced), Kernel, unsafe launch, Event with profiling (C4).

## 0.0.5

- Safe layer part 1: Context, Queue, Buffer with bounds-checked blocking read/write (C3). Design note records the Unpopped lane's answers.

## 0.0.4

- Docs: OpenCL C parser/emitter design note (X1/X2); ROADMAP rows updated.

## 0.0.3

- Loader resolves 46 OpenCL entry points; Runtime::missing_entry_points() and probe report what a driver lacks (C2).

## 0.0.2
